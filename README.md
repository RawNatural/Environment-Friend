# PHP
My PHP full-stack website.

I can use this as a template to remake any other e-commerce store, I have set it up that I can simply change images and products simply and change colors etc. Such that with little effort, I can rebuild and entire new e-commerce store.

In shop.php, I use php functions to spit out new products with ease, simply adding in price, name, image, desc...

I have stripe integrated for payment.

I use MySQL for secure storing of information.

I have many other little features wihtin. It was a fun process building this. It took a lot of work and a lot of hours.
